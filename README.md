# Employee Retention Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict whether an employee is likely to stay or leave a company, based on various HR-related factors. By identifying the key drivers of employee attrition, organizations can take data-driven steps to improve retention and engagement.

# Objectives
- Analyze HR data to identify patterns and trends
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict employee retention
- Identify the most important factors influencing employee attrition
- Provide actionable insights to HR teams

# Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

# Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- Employee satisfaction level
- Last evaluation score
- Number of projects
- Average monthly hours
- Time spent at the company
- Work accidents
- Promotion in the last 5 years
- Department, Salary, etc.

# Project Workflow

1. # Data Cleaning
   Handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting.

2. # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   Visualization of key patterns and relationships.

3. # Feature Engineering
   Encoding categorical variables and scaling.

4. # Model Training  
   Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting.

5. # Model Evaluation
   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.

# Key Insights
- Satisfaction level and average monthly hours strongly influence retention.
- Employees with low evaluation and no promotion history are more likely to leave.
- Random Forest outperformed other models in accuracy.

# How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pritamsaha8342/Employee_Retention.git
